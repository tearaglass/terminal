  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>Delaney Mills</p>

<p>artist / taste engineer / rogue archivist</p>
    
    <p>Delaney Mills is an American interdisciplinary artist, sound designer, rogue systems thinker, and former micro-celebrity operating on the poetic margins of the cultural economy. Born in 1990 and currently living on a generational family compound in South Carolina, Mills is known for her immersive conceptual works that fuse music, installation, interactive technology, and speculative narrative. With a background in Anthropology and Art History, her work approaches lived experience like a forensic ritual, dissecting memory, identity, and societal collapse through audiovisual language, experimental code, and metaphysical design.
    
    Her projects exist at the intersection of mysticism and process, drawing energy from Jungian archetypes made up to win arguments, an outlaw aura, and the feral documentation of contemporary liminal Americana.</p> <p>Mills’ creative trajectory resists easy categorization—she’s been a touring musician, a sound engineer, an accidental political operative, a blockchain researcher, and a digital nomad of both subculture and infrastructure.
    
    Mills is a former member of the band Elvis Depressedly, touring internationally and helping shape the sound of a generation of emotionally raw indie pop. She has collaborated with acts like TV Girl and been embedded in numerous DIY scenes across the U.S. and abroad. She was happiest managing and touring with bands, and working on the South Carolina campaign for Bernie Sanders—two arenas where her capacity to galvanize creative chaos toward meaningful ends shone brightest. In 2023, she was a "freeloader" contestant on Season 2 of the 24/7 reality torture show "Fishtank", improvising and adapting for 7 days despite having Covid for the first time the whole time.

    In recent years, Mills has returned to solo work, rebuilding her creative practice around ritual, interactivity, and scale. She is currently developing an ambitious suite of interconnected projects:
        •	CLIO, a command-line AI agent and future web interface designed to be part mystic scribe, part modular OS, and part game.
        •	MILFJOURNEY, a layered multimedia experience fusing AI-generated waifus, a haunting midwestern backstory, and blockchain permanence—narrated by her alter ego June Vale, a cultural critic uncovering the digital remains of a doomed cartoonist named Dale Elwell.
        •	Celestial Horizons Cruises, a luxury-ritual-cult-meets-cursed-Bandcamp faux-corporation encompassing a record label, fashion house, ARG, and potential real-world cruise ship, on which she someday hopes to outpace civilizational collapse with all of her friends by simply sailing off to sea.
        •	A fully custom audio workstation and VST environment, built from scratch in web tech and JUCE, incorporating LFO modulation, generative visuals, harmonic systems, and strummable interfaces.
        •	A live-streamed C-SPAN-style political call-in and variety show with AI callers, burner phones, and full chaos formatting.
        •	A 70-acre experimental cultural residency, real estate venture, and permaculture farm, called Agata.

    Mills works with tools like Ableton Live, Max for Live, VDMX, p5.js, WebGL, TouchDesigner, and Processing. She builds custom hardware and software instruments, creates shaders and sound sculptures, and has recently become focused on mastering Linux, terminal-based tooling, and building her own AI models. She enjoys working within constraints: she codes like a jazz musician plays, using structure to unlock improvisation. Her dev environment is as much a studio as her DAW.
    
    She’s also a careful archivist of her past, slowly assembling a digital record of her work—one part artistic CV, one part psychogeographic investigation, one part survival guide for fellow psychos. She’s working on an album, a comprehensive CV, and a visual portfolio that functions more like a software repo than a gallery.
    
    She’s obsessed with taste—not just good taste, but the mechanisms through which it propagates. Mills believes in the radical possibility of caring in public, of making vulnerable work in a time allergic to sincerity, of creating systems that reward meaning over metrics. She is known for elevating the work of others, but is now firmly centering her own vision—fueled by a late-onset financial ambition and a commitment to building a lasting creative legacy.
</p>
    <p>Her creative ethos can be distilled as follows:
    Comfort, in a fucked-up world. Memory, as interface. Play, as praxis.</p>
    
    <p>She lives with one foot in the ruins, and steadies the other as a trellis for whatever comes next. If you see her on the street, say nothing—but follow the sound.</p>

  <h2>Artist’s Statement</h2>
  <p>My work is a ritual, not against entropy but alongside it. I use music, code, light, and installation to scratch out sanctuaries for the lost, the haunted, and the half-remembered. I want to build spaces and hybrid mythologies that exist far away from cynicism's alluring exile. Thusfar, everything I've made is a shard. Comfort is resistance; magic is real and love is eternal truth.</p>
